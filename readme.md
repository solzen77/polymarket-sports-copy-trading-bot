# Polymarket Sports Copy Trading Bot (TypeScript) — Top Traders, Automation, Dashboard

Polymarket **sports copy-trading bot** + **Next.js dashboard** for tracking **top sports traders**, selecting traders/markets, and running an automated copy-trading process in **simulation** or **live** mode. Includes an Express API server for Polymarket data (sports, markets, trader history) and real-time-ish bot logs.

## What this bot does (plain English)

If you’re not technical, here’s the simple idea:

- **You choose “who to follow”**: pick one or more top Polymarket sports traders (wallets).
- **You choose “where to trade”**: pick one or more sports market slugs (the markets you care about).
- The bot then **watches those traders’ recent trades** and, when it sees a new BUY/SELL on your selected markets, it **copies the action**:
  - **Simulation mode**: it only logs what it *would* do (no real orders).
  - **Live mode**: it places real orders on Polymarket via the CLOB (requires credentials).

This repository also includes a **dashboard** where you can browse sports/markets, view traders, start/stop the bot, and read the bot logs in a user-friendly way.

## How the copy-trading logic works (step-by-step)

1. **Load configuration**
   - The backend loads settings from `.env` (preferred) or `config.json` (fallback).
   - You provide: followed traders, selected market slugs, and mode (simulation/live).

2. **Resolve market slugs**
   - A “slug” is the market identifier in the URL.
   - The bot converts each slug into a market/condition id so it can filter trades correctly.

3. **Poll trader activity**
   - On a fixed interval (for example every 3 seconds), the bot queries Polymarket’s Data API for each followed trader’s recent trades.
   - It filters down to trades that match your selected markets.

4. **Deduplicate**
   - The bot keeps an in-memory set of “already seen” trades (a unique key per trade) so it does not copy the same action twice.

5. **Copy the action**
   - When a new trade is detected, it decides whether it’s a BUY or SELL and then:
     - **Simulation**: write a clear log line.
     - **Live**: submit a market order through the Polymarket CLOB client.

6. **Logging + monitoring**
   - Every important event is written to a log file and displayed in the dashboard.
   - The API server exposes endpoints to view status and tail the latest logs.

### Important note about latency (why copy-trading exists)
On Polymarket, “top trader” activity can move fast. If you try to manually follow trades, you’ll often be late. This bot exists to reduce that delay by **automating the detection + execution loop**. It can’t guarantee you match the exact same fill price as the top trader, but it helps you react much faster than manual trading.

## Development story (why this repo exists)

This project was built by a developer with **strong experience building sports trading bots**.

- **Phase 1 — manual trading**
  - The first version focused on manual trading tools to learn how Polymarket markets/tokens behave in real time.
  - This phase helped validate market selection, token/outcome mapping, and order mechanics.

- **Phase 2 — studying top traders**
  - After observing the sports leaderboard and traders’ closed positions and trade patterns, it became clear that top traders often act with low latency.

- **Phase 3 — building a sports top-trader copy trading bot**
  - Manual following couldn’t keep up (“I can’t follow top trader’s latency”).
  - The solution was an automated copy-trading loop: poll trades, detect new actions, dedupe, and (optionally) place real orders.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Polymarket API credentials (API key, secret, passphrase) and a private key (or proxy wallet)

## Quickstart (non‑technical, 10 minutes)

This is the easiest way to use the copy‑trading bot with the dashboard.

### Step 1) Install (one time)

In the repo root:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 2) Configure `.env`

Open `.env` and set at least:

- **Simulation mode (safe, recommended first)**:
  - `COPY_TRADING_SLUGS` = comma‑separated market slugs
  - `COPY_TRADING_TRADERS` = comma‑separated trader wallets (0x...)
  - (Optional) `COPY_TRADING_AMOUNT_USD` (default 5)
- **Live mode (real trading)** also requires Polymarket credentials:
  - `POLYMARKET_API_KEY`, `POLYMARKET_API_SECRET`, `POLYMARKET_API_PASSPHRASE`, `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`

Tip: You can find **slugs** by opening a market on Polymarket and copying the last part of the URL.

### Step 3) Start the backend API (Terminal 1)

```bash
npm run api
```

You should see it listening on `http://localhost:4004`.

### Step 4) Start the dashboard (Terminal 2)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 5) Run copy‑trading

You have two options:

- **Option A (recommended): use the dashboard**
  - Go to the copy‑trading page, select traders + slugs, choose **Simulation** or **Real**, then press **Start**.
  - Watch the log panel to confirm it’s running.
- **Option B: run in the terminal**

```bash
# Simulation by default:
npm run copy-trading

# Live orders:
npm run copy-trading:live
```

## Glossary (simple)

- **Trader / wallet**: a Polymarket account address like `0x...` you want to follow.
- **Slug**: the market identifier in the URL (example: `will-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-win-the-2026-nba-finals`).
- **Simulation**: the bot logs actions but does not place real orders.
- **Live / Real**: the bot can place real orders (needs credentials).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set copy-trading vars (and for live trading: Polymarket credentials).
```

## Configuration

The backend now prefers **environment variables** from `.env`. See `.env.example` for the full list.

Key env vars:

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `TRADING_SLUG` | Market slug (e.g. from Polymarket URL). Required to run the trailing bot. |
| `TRADING_CONTINUOUS` | If true, after buying both sides, reset and trail again until market ends |
| `TRADING_TRAILING_STOP_POINT` | Trigger when ask >= lowest + this (e.g. 0.03) |
| `TRADING_TRAILING_SHARES` | Target shares per buy |
| `TRADING_FIXED_TRADE_AMOUNT` | Fallback USD amount per trade |
| `TRADING_MIN_TIME_REMAINING_SECONDS` | Do not open new trades when less than this many seconds remain (0 = trade until closure) |
| `TRADING_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | Poll interval in ms |

**Copy-trading** (for `npm run copy-trading`) env vars:

- `COPY_TRADING_SLUGS`: comma-separated slugs
- `COPY_TRADING_TRADERS`: comma-separated proxy wallets (0x...)
- `COPY_TRADING_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (default 3000)
- `COPY_TRADING_AMOUNT_USD` (default 5)
- `COPY_TRADING_SIMULATION` (default true)

Polymarket credentials (required for LIVE trading via CLOB):

- `POLYMARKET_API_KEY`
- `POLYMARKET_API_SECRET`
- `POLYMARKET_API_PASSPHRASE`
- `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Optional: `POLYMARKET_PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS`, `POLYMARKET_SIGNATURE_TYPE` (0 = EOA, 1 = Proxy, 2 = GnosisSafe)

Optional endpoint overrides:

- `GAMMA_API_URL` (default `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com`)
- `CLOB_API_URL` (default `https://clob.polymarket.com`)
- `DATA_API_BASE` (default `https://data-api.polymarket.com` for the API server)

### Optional: `config.json`
If you don’t set env vars, the code falls back to `config.json` like before. (Env wins when present.)

## Run

**Simulation (default, no real orders):**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm run simulation
# or
npx tsx src/bin/sports-trailing.ts
```

**Live trading:**

```bash
npm run live
# or
npm run dev -- --no-simulation
```

**Sports list only (no slugs):**

```bash
npm run sports-list
```

**Live slugs for a selected sport (run after sports-list to pick a sport):**

```bash
npm run live-slugs -- nba
npm run live-slugs -- nfl
npm run live-slugs -- 34
```

**List current live slugs for all sports (to copy into config):**

```bash
npm run list-slugs
# Or only one sport, e.g. NBA:
npm run dev -- --list-slugs=nba
```

**Top sports traders (daily rank, top 50 by PNL):**

```bash
npm run sports-top-traders
# Optional:
npm run sports-top-traders -- --orderBy=VOL
npm run sports-top-traders -- --timePeriod=WEEK
npm run sports-top-traders -- --limit=10
```

**Latest finished market history for a chosen top trader (last 7 days):**

```bash
# By rank (1–50 from sports-top-traders list):
npm run trader-history -- 1
# By proxy wallet:
npm run trader-history -- 0x56687bf447db6ffa42ffe2204a05edaa20f55839
# Optional: --days=7 (default), --timePeriod=DAY|WEEK|MONTH|ALL when using rank
npm run trader-history -- 5 --timePeriod=WEEK --days=14
```

**Copy-trading bot (copy selected traders’ buy/sell on selected slugs):**

Set `COPY_TRADING_SLUGS` (comma-separated market slugs) and `COPY_TRADING_TRADERS` (comma-separated proxy wallet addresses). Run:

```bash
npm run copy-trading
# Simulation by default; for live orders:
npm run copy-trading:live
```

While running: **start** / **stop** / **restart** (copy on/off), **buy &lt;token_id&gt; &lt;usd&gt;** / **sell &lt;token_id&gt; &lt;usd&gt;** (manual orders), **status**, **quit**.

## Troubleshooting (common issues)

- **Dashboard shows 404 for backend endpoints**
  - Make sure the backend is running with `npm run api` and your frontend `.env` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4004`.

- **“Live” mode doesn’t place orders**
  - You must set Polymarket credentials in `.env` (`POLYMARKET_API_KEY`, `POLYMARKET_API_SECRET`, `POLYMARKET_API_PASSPHRASE`, `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`).
  - Try simulation first to confirm slugs + traders are correct.

- **Bot seems slow / misses trades**
  - Copy‑trading is based on polling the Data API, so it cannot perfectly match top‑trader speed. Reduce `COPY_TRADING_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` if needed.


**Manual trading bot (manual buy/sell from current market state):**

```bash
npm run manual-trading -- <slug>
# Live:
npm run manual-trading:live -- <slug>
```

In the prompt, use:
- **refresh** to update bid/ask/mid
- **buy <outcomeIndex|tokenId> <usd>**
- **sell <outcomeIndex|tokenId> <usd>**
- **quit**

**Market state + chart data for a chosen live slug:**

```bash
npm run market-state -- <slug>

# Example:
npm run market-state -- will-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-win-the-2026-nba-finals
```

This prints:
- Basic market info (question, conditionId, end_date_iso)
- Current bid/ask/mid for each outcome token
- CSV-style `tokenId,outcome,timestamp,price` series that you can import into a charting tool.

**Custom config path:**

```bash
npm run dev -- --config ./my-config.json
```

**Backend API (for frontend / other clients):**

```bash
npm run api
# Listens on http://localhost:4004 (override with PORT=4001 npm run api)
```

Endpoints (read-only, CORS enabled):

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/sports` | Sports list |
| GET | `/api/sports/tree?livePerTag=5` | Sports grouped tree + live slugs per tag |
| GET | `/api/sports/:tagId/live?limit=50` | Live markets for a sport tag |
| GET | `/api/traders` | SPORTS leaderboard |
| GET | `/api/traders/:wallet/history?days=7` | Closed positions for a trader |
| GET | `/api/markets/:slug` | Market details by slug |
| GET | `/api/tokens/:tokenId/history?interval=1h` | Price history for one token |
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check |
| GET | `/api/copy-trading/status` | Copy-trading process status |
| GET | `/api/copy-trading/logs?limit=100` | Tail copy-trading log file |
| POST | `/api/copy-trading/start` | Start copy-trading (body: `{ simulation, traders, slugs }`) |
| POST | `/api/copy-trading/stop` | Stop copy-trading |

The server uses `.env` when present (env wins), otherwise falls back to `config.json`, otherwise defaults to Polymarket production URLs.

**Frontend (Next.js dashboard):**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Optional: set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4004 to use the backend API
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 for traders list, trader history charts, and market state by slug. With `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` set, all data is loaded via the backend API above.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
node dist/bin/sports-trailing.js
```

## Architecture

- **config** – Loads `.env` (preferred) or `config.json`, plus CLI args (`--simulation`, `--no-simulation`, `--config`)
- **api** – `PolymarketApi`: Gamma (get market by slug), CLOB (get market details, get price). Order placement via `@polymarket/clob-client`
- **api-data** – Read-only Data/Gamma/CLOB fetchers (leaderboard, closed positions, market by slug, price history). Used by **api-server** and reusable by CLIs.
- **bin/api-server** – HTTP API server (Express). Serves `/api/sports`, `/api/traders`, `/api/traders/:wallet/history`, `/api/markets/:slug`, `/api/tokens/:tokenId/history`, plus `/api/copy-trading/*`. Uses `.env` when present (env wins) or `config.json` for API base URLs when present.
- **trader** – `Trader.executeBuy()`: validates time remaining, computes size, then simulation (log + in-memory pending) or live (place market order via CLOB client)
- **bin/sports-trailing** – Main loop: resolve market by slug, fetch both token prices every `check_interval_ms`, run trailing state machine (WaitingFirst → FirstBuyPending → FirstBought → second buy → Done or reset if continuous), exit when market end time is reached.
- **frontend** – Next.js app (traders, trader history chart, market state chart). Uses backend API when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set, otherwise Polymarket public APIs.
